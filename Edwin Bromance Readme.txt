Mod Name: Edwin Bromance

Premise: An Edwin Friendship Mod that features a "barely-tolerated-acquaintances to True Bros" friendship arc.

DO NOT USE WITH EDWIN ROMANCE.
	My interpretation of Edwin and Laufey's interpretation are narratively incompatible.

/////////////////////
//FEATURES:
/////////////////////
- Friendship!
- 9 talks. The first 3 are timed, 2 are Edwina-related, the remaining are main-quest related
- A chance for nonevil Charnames to turn Edwin LN
I see Edwin’s Evilness as a manifestation of his extreme selfishness, unempathetic-ness, and ruthlessness. By making Charname into a genuine friend, he loses (or at least softens) that part of himself, and thus shifts to LN.

/////////////////////
//ASSUMPTIONS:
/////////////////////
Assumes that Edwin already knows you in some capacity and had traveled with you at some point, whether in BG1, SoD, or some headcanon’d interlude.


/////////////////////
//WALKTHROUGH
/////////////////////
3 talks are timered.
A talk happens when Edwin is Edwina
A talk happens after he changes back.

A talk happens when you arrive at Brynnlaw.
A talk happens in the Underdark.
A talk happens after you defeat Bodhi.

The final talk happens in Suldanassalar and ONLY IF EDWIN LIKES YOU ENOUGH. He has a friendship variable that increases or decreases depending on your responses in previous talks. A nonevil charname can change his alignment if desired.
